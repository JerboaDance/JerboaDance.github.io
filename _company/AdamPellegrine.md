Adam is very excited to be performing with this amazing group of dancers in Jerboa.  He hails from the University of Alabama where he trained in theater and dance.  Adam has performed across the nation and around the world, most recently coming off the national tour of Urban Cowboy the Musical.  He has also performed throughout the city, including the world premier of Nutcracker: Rated R at the Theater for the New City, as well as the role of Jack in The Naked Dead Elephant… at the Cherry Lane Theater.  Some of  his favorite roles include Bernardo in West Side Story, Anthony Martini in One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest, and Rosencrantz in Shakespearear’s Hamlet.  He would like to extend a special thank you to family and friends for all of their love, guidance, and support and for being there with him every step of the way.
