In his second year with JERBOA Dance, Alex Ung is giddy to be in his first burlesque show. A hip hop
dancer turned contemporary/modern, Alex started his career in college as a hip hop
teacher/choreographer. Now his styles vary from crew-style hip hop to contemporary jazz to Broadway
and Musical Theatre, and even contemporary ballet. He’s taught at Pacific Northwest Ballet School,
Seattle Children’s Theatre, Bainbridge Ballet, Northwest School of Dance, and Momentum Dance. He’s
made award-winning choreography for Bainbridge Ballet Competition Dance Team and also
choreographed for Olympic Performance Group. On stage, Alex has performed with Peaches Christ
Productions, Seattle Musical Theatre, Bainbridge Performing Arts, Olympic Ballet Theatre, Olympic
Performance Group, Seattle PRIDE Mainstage, and Pacific MusicWorks, among other dance and theater
companies. He spends his free time rock climbing, biking, and backpacking (as mountains and ocean are
not native to this Iowan), while also finding time to teach and substitute at PNB School and Seattle
Children’s Theatre, and creating with his amazing JERBOA Dance comrades.
