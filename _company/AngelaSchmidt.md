Angela Schmidt began her ballet studies at the age of 13 at the Michigan Classical Ballet Company and later at the Metropolitan Ballet Academy. She participated in four seasons of Regional Dance America and attended summer intensives at the Boston Ballet, Kirov Academy in Washington D.C., Burklyn Ballet Theatre, and Ballet Austin. She also received scholarships to Houston Ballet, Ballet West, and ABT Detroit. 

Angela took a break from ballet to attend the University of Michigan. Upon moving to New York, she rekindled her love for dance and performed with the Albano Ballet Company, Jersey City Ballet, and appeared in Valentina Kozlova's International Ballet Competition. Upon moving to Seattle she has performed with Concord dance collective, Julie Tobiasson's Ballet Bird, and Dance Conservatory Seattle. She is thrilled to be performing with Jerboa and contributing to the Seattle dance scene.
