Chelsea took their first ballet class at the age of 3 but didn’t like the pink shoes or the standing still thing. However, their love of movement started young and they spent the bulk of their youth competing in the Texas junior olympic women’s  gymnastics program. In their 20s, they discovered AcroYoga and partner acrobatics and briefly toured with a local circus troupe in Chicago. In 2012, they began modern dance as well as tap, jazz, ballet and hip hop at eXit Space school of dance where they currently dance. They are excited to perform with jerboa where they get a chance to combine their love of both dance and acrobatics.
