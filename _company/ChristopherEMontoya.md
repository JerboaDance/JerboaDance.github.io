Christopher E. Montoya was born in the small town of St. Johns, Arizona but grew up in South Phoenix. Mr. Montoya began his academic journey with the University of Arizona, taking time off periodically to work with professional dance companies. He started his professional career with Gus Giordano Jazz Dance Chicago as a second company member. He continued his career with David Taylor Dance Theatre, Scorpius Dance Theatre, and Center Dance Ensemble, guesting periodically with Queen City Ballet and Legacy Dance Theater. He also enjoyed dancing on pointe with Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo, performing as Doris Vidanya around the world, including Japan, Israel, France, Austria, Brazil, Chile, Finland, Spain, and Italy. 


Moving to Seattle in 2011, Mr. Montoya completed his undergraduate degree with Cornish College of the Arts, while also performing with Seattle Dance Project and Men In Dance. While at Cornish, his goals shifted from professional work to teaching dance in higher education, which led him to receive his Master of Fine Arts from the University of Washington. He chose the University of Washington dance department because its curriculum and faculty is one of the best in the country, and he knew the program would prepare him for teaching at the collegiate level while assisting him to understand the importance of dance education. A highlight while attending the University of Washington was working with Chamber Dance Company performing works: To Have and To Hold and Moonlight by Shapiro and Smith, Petrousckhaâ€™s Room by Michel Fokine, Cloudless by Susan Marshall, and Center of My Heart by Douglas Elkins. Mr. Montoya is most proud of the class that he developed on the Romantic era of ballet with the assistance of Professor Hannah Wiley.


After graduate school, Mr. Montoya began working with Spectrum Dance Theater as the Ballet Division Head, which then turned into the School Director. For the last few years he has been teaching open class for Dance Fremont, and was recently enjoying his role as the Managing Director of Dance Fremont. He would like to further develop his studies of ballet history and looks forward to teaching future generations of dancers at <a href="https://www.danceconservatoryseattle.com/">DANCE CONSERVATORY Seattle</a>.
