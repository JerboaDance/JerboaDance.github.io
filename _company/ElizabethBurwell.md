After graduating from Birmingham-Southern College with a degree in French and dance, Elizabeth moved to New York to pursue a career in dance. She’s danced with such notables as Saba Dance Theater, Kenny Larson and Beth Soll. She also appeared in Lois Greenfield’s Breaking Bounds calendar. Elizabeth and her husband, Clay, own High Performance NYC, a private personal training facility in New York. There, she works as a personal trainer fusing her dance training with various other techniques such as Pilates and Kettlebells to help her clients get fit. She feels very lucky to have two careers that she loves. Speaking of love, she recently got a Doberman puppy named Zulu.
