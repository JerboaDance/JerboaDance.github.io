She went on to perform in many regional theatres, for Disney, and went on the road with national tours of Gigi and CanCan. Her favorite roles include; “Val”, in the European tour of A Chorus Line, and most recently, the 1st cover for the leading lady, “Stephanie”, in the Broadway tour of Saturday Night Fever. Julie now is also pursuing acting in Film and TV! She has a small recurring part on One Life to Live, and played her first supporting role in an indie feature film last year.
