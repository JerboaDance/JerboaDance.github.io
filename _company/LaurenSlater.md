Lauren Christina Slater grew up and trained in sunny Encinitas, CA., studying dance and theater with Janice Lee, Carol Mead, Jean Isaacs, Faith Jensen-Ismay, Tom Hansen, Currie Peterson, and Sue Gilson. Beginning at age 10, she attended pre-professional training programs on scholarship at The Kirov Academy, BalletMet and Pennsylvania Ballet’s Rock School, where she was also a trainee. 

Obsessed with movie musicals of the 1930s-1960s, Lauren loved the expression and glamour of a performers life. The lure of LA led her to work as a professional Rave dancer, sponsored by JNCO Jeans, for almost two years. This opened up her mind of what a dance career could look like, exposing her to the worlds of break/club dance, drag and burlesque. Concurrently, Lauren graduated magna cum laude with a degree in Dance and Kinesiology from UCSB.

Upon graduating, she moved to Europe, where she performed works of William Forsythe with members of the Frankfort Ballet, as well as working with post-modern artist Anne Therese de Keersmaeker. Settling next in San Francisco, Lauren became a founding member of the contemporary company LEVYdance, and has also danced for Larry Kegwin, Monica Bill Barnes, Christopher Pilafian, San Diego Dance Theater, Mojalet Dance Collective, Abigail Munn, Capacitor (Jodi Lomask), and Monique Jenkinson (Fauxnique). 

She moved to Seattle with her husband, musician Doug Major,  in September 2017, where she’s found an artistic home working with Lily Verlaine (House of Verlaine, Verlaine and McCann Productions The Land of the Sweets) and Jerboa Dance. This is her first season with Jerboa Dance and is honored to be working with these great artists! 

Lauren is also a professional health coach, yoga teacher and Classical Pilates instructor. She founded HIVE Wellness Consultancy in 2018, with the mission of sharing her knowledge of the body, mind and soul.
