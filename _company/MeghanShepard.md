Even though Meghan Shepard took her first dance class at age 3, she really began her career at 16.  Spending 3 years in LA, she expanded her training and experience by working with multiple choreographers. Returning to Portland, Meghan performed locally and went on her first tour with  Extreme Dance Co. Meghan then moved to Seattle to further pursue dance. In 2007, she graduated Magna Cum Laude from Cornish College of the Arts where she performed with many prominent choreographers. Meghan continues to dance in Seattle, and has been dancing with Jerboa Dance since 2008. She is thrilled to be dancing again in the companyâ€™s new season.
