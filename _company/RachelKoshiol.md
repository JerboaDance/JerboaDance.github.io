Rachel Koshiol started dance classes at the age of 4 and has been moving ever since. While growing up in Minnesota, Rachel danced competitively at Hopkins Dance Center while spending her summers training at MDT and Ballet Arts. During the summer of 2004, Rachel attended American Ballet Theatre’s summer intensive program at the University of Alabama. During college, she paused her dance career to focus on studies but felt called to return immediately after graduation. For two seasons, she competed at an adult level, and during the winter of 2014, she preformed with the Minnesota Dance Collaborative for their opening season of “HoliDaydream”. Since moving to Seattle, Rachel has worked with choreographers including Alicia Mullikin, Marlo Ariz, Maya Soto and Maxie Jamal. She continues to preform in a diverse mix productions, most recently for USC Event’s “Paradiso Festival”. Rachel craves unique styles that blur lines of standard genres and push her physical and mental boundaries. She is excited to continue her exploration with Jerboa Dance.
