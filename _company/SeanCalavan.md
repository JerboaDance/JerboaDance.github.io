Sean Calavan started taking dance class on a whim when he was 8 years old, and has loved it ever since. In 1999, he received the Dance With the Force award from the LADF convention/competition, and spent the summer training at EDGE performing Arts Center in Hollywood, CA. Since then, Sean has performed onboard 7 different ships for Holland America in addition to working as an assistant choreographer for the company that hires the entertainment, Stiletto Entertainment in Los Angeles. In LA, he has worked with many choreographers including Patti Columbo, John Charron, Tommy Tune, Carla Kama, Adam Parson, Mandy Moore, and Terri Best. Sean is very excited to be making his Seattle dance debut with Jerboa Dance, and is looking forward to a new adventure in the Pacific Northwest.
