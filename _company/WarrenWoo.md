Warren Woo is a photographer, videographer, yoga instructor, trainer, choreographer, and dancer in the Seattle area. He graduated as a dance major at the University of Washington and actively participated as a dance student association officer, performer, and choreographer, along, with conducting honors research on dance partnering. Born in Hawaii and having to relocate often, he was homeschooled and studied music in his youth. His development as a physical mover began with Ultimate Frisbee, yoga, running and weight training in his late teens. He found his passion for dance in social partner dance and gradually found his way to ballet, contemporary and circus training over the years. Frequently collaborating with those in the area he has had the opportunity to present work at Converge Dance Festival, and perform at the UW, Full Tilt, Strictly Seattle, Men in Dance, Battle for the Dance Belt, and companies including the Cabiri, Karin Stevens Dance, Relay Dance Collective, Northwest Ballet Theater, and more.
