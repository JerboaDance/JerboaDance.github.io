Jennifer Elder discovered her love of dance at the age of 12 after gymnastics, baton twirling, tennis, horseback riding, track and field and swimming didn’t quite work out. A native of the Pacific Northwest, Jen received her dance training at the Southwest Washington Dance Center in Ballet and Modern where she was a member of the Southwest Washington Ballet Ensemble and Blacken Tan Dance. She later went on to earn her BFA in Modern Dance graduating Cum Laude from the University of Utah. While attending the U of U, she danced for the department’s Performing Dance Company, performing original works by Abby Fiat, Eric Handman, and Brent Schneider. Since moving to Seattle in 2008, Jen has made her own work, which has appeared in the BOOST Dance Festival, Northwest Dance Festival, and TAKE pause. Jen has had the honor to dance for local Seattle artists and companies such as Marlo Martin, Michele Miller/Catapult, Khambatta Dance Company, DASSdance, Whibey Island Dance Theater, Jerboa Dance Company, Redd Legg Dance, and Northwest Dance Syndrome. Currently, Jen is proud to be a continuing member of Badmarmar Dance under the direction of Marlo Martin.
