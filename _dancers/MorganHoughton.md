name: Morgan Houghton

Born in Seattle WA Morgan began dancing during High School. First taking Jazz at a local studio he began thoroughly enjoying himself. Martial arts, sports and stunt work with friends propelled him to continue dancing in college where he eventually came to realize that he truly had a passion for dance. As one who has always loved movement in so many various forms, Morgan continues to dance and pounce on any opportunities to do more stunt work, photo shoots and anything that inspires movement, drives the soul and allows Morgan to play. He would like to thank his parents for their unending support throughout his life and their encouragement with whatever drove him at the time. He would also like to thank all the dance instructors over the years that continued to inspire and challenge him. Without these people and many more Morgan would not be where he is today.
