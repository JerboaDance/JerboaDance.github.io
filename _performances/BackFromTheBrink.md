This acrobatic, energetic modern dance ballet takes audiences on a gripping journey into the human psyche. Conceived around the classic stages of grief, Act I begins after a traumatic event leads the dancers to reflect on their lives. Act II moves into the discovery of how to push forward, build new relationships, find community, and hope.
