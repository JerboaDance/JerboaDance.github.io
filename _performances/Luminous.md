After a four year hiatus, Jerboa Dance is back! Come in out of the darkness and join us for a fun evening of dance, sexiness, and a DJ’d afterparty. Be entertained by sultry cabaret, witty dialogue, spinning lights, acrobatics, drag, burlesque, and, of course, the sexier side of our modern, athletic partnering.
VIP tickets got seating in front-row tables with wait-service during the show and celebrated Valentine’s Day in style with these exciting seats with complementary drinks and chocolates.
