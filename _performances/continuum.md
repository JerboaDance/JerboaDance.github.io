*continuum* is an exploration the complexities of human relationships and the patterns we fall into, both good and bad. As is Jerboa Danceâ€™s style, it is an acrobatic, energetic work relying on raw emotion and the strong technical background of the dancers to draw in the audience. Rather than a story with a clear beginning and end, continuum is a window into the moments of our lives.
